### Story
I cannot disclose who gave these files to me, but I can say why they're being publicized now.
Stummy was arguing with me when I was just messing around sending random snippets of code just to taunt, and he had asked me for the files that I had for this, and I let him see it. Stummy, Outmoon, and Doot started arguing with me over how these files are useless, unimportant, etc.. So I had told them that if it's truly useless, that I could open-source these files that I have and them being fine with it, and they said "nobody cares if you do", so here we are. :D

### Notes for use
- The "main" file for the interface, utility, etc.. are in "/Source/V1/Ligma_Main.rbxmx", it will appear that it's all KeyFrames, but in Studio use the explorer filter and type "ScreenGui", "Script", etc.., and you should find where it's located.
- I do not hold any liability for these files, and I for a fact know some are even currupted (Mainly the PLinkers), and I'm providing exactly what I got and recieved with no modifications.
- It has been pointed out that some of these files are related to "Voxel", a project by Outmoon. I'm not sure why that's in here, but whatever.

### Have fun!
Dig around, mess with these files, etc.. I don't care.
